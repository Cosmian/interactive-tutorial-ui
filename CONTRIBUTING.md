## Adding new pages :

The single page tree structure is centralized in the following file : [`src/utils/pageConfig.tsx`](src/utils/pageConfig.tsx).

In order to add, remove or change the name/address a page, you will need to modify this file, as changing the logic of navigationConfig.tsx might introduce bugs.
