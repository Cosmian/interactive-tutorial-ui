        Cosmian VM allows you to deploy an application on a cloud provider instance, running in a confidential context with verifiability at

        A confidential VM is instanciated from a cloud provider platform, including Cosmian VM solution. After installing all dependencies,
        the VM is snapshotted and integrity checks can be performed on the running application, in order to verify the running code and
        infrastructure.

      <p>Cosmian verification process is performed by the Admin sys, requesting on the running confidential VM, and checks:</p>

        <li>IMA measurement list (containing the list of executed file's hash digest)</li>
        <li>
          TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) elements to provide assurance that the code is running on secure and confidential hardware

        <li>TPM (Trusted Platform Module) elements to attest a TEE and the integrity of the system (IMA) </li>
